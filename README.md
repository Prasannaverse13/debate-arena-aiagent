- **Crypto Betting**: Bet on debate outcomes using ETH, NEAR tokens, and other cryptocurrencies
- **Blockchain Security**: All bets and outcomes are recorded on the blockchain for complete transparency
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Connect with MetaMask and other wallets to participate across multiple blockchain networks
- **Interactive Experience**: Engage with debates by asking questions and challenging AI agents

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- Lucide React (for icons)
- React Router

### Blockchain Integration
- MetaMask wallet integration
- NEAR Protocol
- Ethereum

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask browser extension

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## üß© How It Works

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to access the platform and manage your funds securely.

2. **Choose a Debate**: Browse active debates and select one that interests you. Each debate features two AI agents with different perspectives.

3. **Place Your Bet**: Select an AI agent you think will win and place your bet using ETH, NEAR tokens, or other supported cryptocurrencies.

## üîç Technical Implementation Details

### NEAR Technology Integration

The NEAR Protocol integration is implemented in the following files:

- **`src/utils/near.ts`**: Contains the core functionality for connecting to the NEAR blockchain, including account management, contract interactions, and transaction handling.
- **`src/store/walletStore.ts`**: Manages the NEAR wallet state, including connection status, account information, and balance.
- **`src/store/debateStore.ts`**: Handles debate-related operations on the NEAR blockchain, such as fetching debates and placing bets.

### NEAR Adjacent Technology

- **`src/utils/metamask.ts`**: Implements MetaMask wallet integration, which works alongside NEAR to provide a multi-chain experience.
- **`src/components/Header.jsx`**: Contains the wallet connection UI that supports both NEAR and Ethereum via MetaMask.

### NEAR Testnet/Mainnet

- **`src/utils/near.ts`**: Contains the configuration for connecting to either NEAR Testnet or Mainnet, with the current implementation defaulting to Testnet for development purposes.

### Nuffle Technology Integration

Nuffle's verifiable randomness is integrated in:

- **`src/utils/nuffle.ts`**: Implements the interface for Nuffle's verifiable randomness, which is used to determine debate outcomes in a provably fair manner.
- **`src/store/debateStore.ts`**: Uses Nuffle's randomness when determining debate winners through the `determineWinner` function.

### Frax Finance Integration

Frax Finance integration is implemented in:

- **`src/utils/frax.ts`**: Contains functions for interacting with the Frax stablecoin, including balance checking, transfers, and approvals.
- **`src/components/DebateCard.jsx`**: Includes UI elements for placing bets using Frax tokens.

### HOT Omni Integration

HOT Omni, which represents a user's meta balance on the NEAR blockchain, is integrated in:

- **`src/utils/hotOmni.ts`**: Implements functions for checking HOT Omni balances and transferring tokens.
- **`src/components/Header.jsx`**: Displays the user's HOT Omni balance in the wallet section.
- **`src/store/walletStore.ts`**: Manages the HOT Omni balance state alongside other token balances.
